# programmingPrinciples

This repository is dedicated to learning and practicing programming principles using Python. The main objective is to develop a solid understanding of fundamental programming concepts and learn how to apply them efficiently using Python.

## ðŸ“˜ Description

This project follows topics from W3Schools' Python tutorials as part of a university programming course. It is structured into well-organized parts, and more content will be added over time â€” including projects and additional learning resources beyond W3.

- ðŸ”§ **Requirements:** Just have Python installed on your computer (any recent version like 3.8+ is fine). No extra libraries are needed.
- ðŸ“ˆ **Status:** This project is just getting started. More files and projects will be added gradually.

## ðŸ§  Topics Covered (So Far)

- Python basics  
- Variables and data types  
- String operations  
- Control flow (if, else, etc.)  
- Comments and print statements  

More topics and practice sections will be added as the learning progresses.

## ðŸš€ How to Use

You can clone or download the repo and run the Python files in any IDE or code editor that supports Python. The files are ordered logically, so it's recommended to follow them in order to build your understanding step by step.

```bash
# Example
python part1.py
